# Investment Trading PLatform 
Investment Tading Platform is a digital interface or software system that enables users to buy, sell, and manage various financial assets such as stocks, bonds, ETFs, options, cryptocurrencies, and other securities.

The platform are typically designed to facilitate a range of investment activities and trading strategies for individuals, financial advisors, or institutional investors.

In my project, which runs in the Code Institute mock terminal on Heroku, the platform enables users to interactively manage a stock portfolio, simulating trading activities like buying, selling, depositing, and withdrawing funds, all while maintaining an up-to-date portfolio value.

In this Project-Portfolio, the Platform offers tools to manage and track the investment, showing gains, losses, and asset allocation.

Here is the live version of my project.

## How starting investing on the platform ?

The base of the platform is a digital investment portfolio management system that allows users to manage stock holdings and cash investments interactively. The yfinance library is a powerful tool that allows the user to access stock market data for a variety of companies in real time, making it useful for tracking and trading stocks. 

Yfinance provides up-to-date information on stock prices. In this setup, the user use yfinance to get stock price data for buying and selling stocks in his portfolio.

First, the user enters an initial investment amount that will act as starting buying power. This is the cash available to make his first stock purchases.

The platform offers more options for the user to choose what and how he wants to invest.
